## Intro

The Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification is a well-known credential for info 
security professionals. For me, getting this certification was a long-term goal. 
I wanted to formalize my skills and gain some recognition in the cybersecurity world.

I originally planned to study for the CISSP before starting my PhD, hoping to finish it while 
I was studying. But balancing both was tough. After I graduated, I finally found the right time 
to focus on the certification.

I studied for about three months, putting in 2-3 hours during the week and 4-5 hours on weekends. 
On September 9, 2024, I passed the CISSP exam after just 100 questions!

## Is it worth it?

Before committing to any certification, I always ask if it’s really worth the time and money. 
Will it truly help my career, or is it just another title to add to the wall? To make a good choice, 
I talked to friends and colleagues and read through a lot of articles and forums. Opinions were mixed, 
but most agreed it can boost career prospects, even if it doesn’t necessarily make you a better cybersecurity 
professional. I agree with that, but I also keep in mind that the CISSP exam 
isn’t meant to test hands-on skills. It assumes candidates are already experienced cybersecurity professionals, 
and (ISC)² verifies this after passing the exam. 
With that in mind, here are my reasons for pursuing the CISSP certification.

#### Non-technical aspects of cyber security

The CISSP exam is particularly interesting because it bridges the gap between 
the technical and non-technical aspects of cybersecurity. Coming from a background as 
a software developer and researcher, where I’ve delved deeply into the technical workings 
of security mechanisms, I realized I had been missing key layers that are essential to 
securing organizations but are not purely technical.

Topics such as data ownership, policies, procedures, risk management, business continuity, 
and legal considerations were relatively new to me. Although I had an intuitive understanding 
of their importance while working in cybersecurity environments, they were always handled by others. 
Studying for the CISSP helped me see how these elements fit into the broader security picture, 
giving me a more comprehensive understanding of how they all interconnect.


#### Systematization of knowledge

When studying for the CISSP exam, you’ll notice it covers a wide range of topics. 
The official study guide alone is over 1,000 pages, so there’s a lot to take in. 
But the exam isn’t about memorizing every protocol or system—it’s more about understanding key concepts, 
how they’re applied in the real world, and how different aspects of security work together.

What I found really interesting during my preparation was learning the backstory behind some 
technologies—why certain choices were made and how things evolved over time. While that kind of 
historical insight might not be something you use day-to-day, it’s definitely valuable knowledge.

CISSP gives you a big-picture view of cybersecurity, and that was the most useful part for me. 
As someone with a Linux background, I also appreciated getting to learn about other proprietary 
security solutions. Overall, the study material offers a really solid overview of cybersecurity, 
which makes the whole certification process worth it.

#### Language

In the industry, every team has its own way of communicating. Managers focus on deliverables and risks, engineers 
talk about features and deadlines, while security teams discuss vulnerabilities and threats. 
Studying for the CISSP helps you understand how each group views and talks about security.

Since communication is crucial in cybersecurity, the CISSP equips you with the language needed to 
effectively engage with stakeholders, managers, engineers, and security professionals alike. 
The next step is putting this knowledge into practice in real-world situations.

#### Formal Requirement
The CISSP exam mainly shows you’ve got a solid grasp of non-technical security knowledge, but adding it to your CV 
can still give you a boost during hiring. Some job listings mention CISSP as a “nice-to-have,” which can help you
get through that first HR screen.

Still, I think certifications like CISSP are best as a bonus rather than the main focus. 
Having a strong GitHub, a blog, or a good portfolio of projects often goes further in showing what 
you can actually do.

## Study materials

There are a ton of books and question banks out there for CISSP prep, but just make sure you’re using more recent ones. 
I like digital materials, but I also enjoy writing notes by hand. I mainly used the Sybex Study Guide 
and the All-in-One Exam Guide, focusing on the parts I needed. Then I did practice questions to find 
my weak spots and went back to review those areas. Here are the resources that helped me the most.


**Oreilly library**\
If you can learn from digital materials instead of paper books, Oreilly library is definitely worth considering. 
It costs about $50 a month (as of October 2024) and gives you access to a ton of books and videos, 
including the Sybex Official Study Guide and some exam practice books. I think this option is more 
cost-effective and environmentally friendly than buying physical books.

**Learnzapp** \
Learnzapp is a great resource for practicing questions once you’ve read the books and tackled the questions in them. 
It offers both a mobile app and a web version, and you can even practice in exam mode. 
I found it really helpful to see just how tiring it can be to answer over 100 questions in one sitting.

**Study Notes and Theory** \
Another solid resource is the study materials and questions from Luke Ahmed. His question set is intentionally quite 
challenging, so I recommend using it after you’ve gone through all the other materials. 
Just avoid doing these questions right before the exam. Since they can be harder and trickier 
than the actual test, you might end up feeling discouraged or lose confidence if you can’t hit 
the passing score.

**Destination Certification Videos** \
Rob Witcher's CISSP MindMaps are great for reviewing and pinpointing the areas where you need more study. 
The videos cover all the domains and summarize the key topics effectively.

**Technical Institute of America** \
I found Andrew Ramdayal's videos just before the exam, and they really helped me feel confident about the topics. 
After tackling his 50 CISSP Practice Questions, I knew I was ready to take the exam.

## Summary

Passing the CISSP exam was a fantastic journey. I learned a ton, and I’m really glad I went for it. 
Even before the exam, I wasn’t sure if I was ready, but I know I tend to second-guess myself. 
I totally recommend it for anyone who's been in cybersecurity for a few years and wants a good 
overview of the field. The certification is just the cherry on top.

Next on my list - maybe OSCP!
