## Intro
CISSP is Certified Information Systems Security Professional.
It is a certification for information security professionals.

My motivation was to gain a formal and industry recognized cyber security certification.
And CISSP was always on my list.
I started studying before staring PhD, then I wanted to do it during PhD, but it was too much.
Finally, after graduation, it was the right time.

The total study time was around 3 months, studing a 2-3 hours during a week and 4-5 over the weekend.

I passed CISSP exam on 2024-09-09 after 100 questions.

## Is it worth it?

Always before doing certification, I ask myself is it worth spending my time and money on it.
Does it really bring value or is it just a piece of paper to put on the wall.
I asked my friends and colleagues and went through many articles and forums.
The status and recognition of CISSP is very high, however, it is not a certification that will prove your skills.
The assumttion is that you already are the experienced cyber security proffesional. This is a mandatory requirement
to obtain certification and ISC2 verifies that after passing the exam. With this in mind, below I list my arguments
to do CISSP certification.

#### Non-technical aspects of cyber security
The CISSP exam is an interesting one because it builds the bridge between technical and non-technical aspects of cyber security.
With my background of software developer and researcher diging deep in how security mechanisms work, 
I was definatelly missing the layers that are not technical but crucial in ensuring secuirty for organizations. 
Data owners, policies, procedures, risk management, business continuity, legal aspects, were all new to me.
Even though wroking in cyber security environments, I intuitivelly understand the importance of these aspects, 
it was always someone else's job to take care of them. After studying for CISSP, I can see all those elements of the puzzle
and how they fit together.


#### Systematization of knowledge
While studying to the CISSP exam you will find that its domians cover wide range of topics.
Even if you only consider the official study guide, which has over 1000 pages, it is huge bulk of knowledge to digest.
However, the exam is not about memorizing protocols and systems, but understanding the concepts, how they are applied in real world,
and how they coexist and interact with each other. Interestingly enough, by preparing to the exam, I was able to 
understand the history of some technologies, why certain decisions were made, and how they evolved over time.
While it might not be useful in day-to-day work, it is definatelly great lessons learned.
CISSP gives a holistic view on cyber security and for me this was the most valuable aspect of the certification.
Being Linux guy, I enjoyed learning about other proprietary cyber security solutions.
Overall, I strongly think that the study materials for the exam give the comprehensive overview of cyber security.


#### Language
Working in the industry you will find that every team has its own language. 
Managers talk about deliverables and risks, engineers about features and deadlines, security guys about vulnerabilities and threats.
While studing to the CISSP, you actually learn how others perceive and talk about security.
As the communication is the key in cyber security, the CISSP exam will give you the language to talk to stakeholders, 
managers, engineers, and security guys. One left thing to do is to practice it in real world.

#### Formal Requirement
While CISSP exam is more of a proof of non-technical knowledge, having it on your CV can help in recruitment proccess.
Some jobs offers have CISSP exam in the nice-to-have section, so it might help you to go through the 
HR first filter. However, in my opinion, certificate such as CISSP should be an addition to your portfolio, not the main focus.
I believe it is more valuable to have a good GitHub profile, a blog, or a portfolio of your projects.

## Study materials


Many materials. 
I listed ones that helped me the most.

**Oreilly library** \
If you can learn from digital materials instead of paper books, it is definatley worth it.
It costs roughly $50 for month (checked at October 2024) and gives you access to many books and videos.
The resources include Sybex Official Study Guide and a few exam practice books.
I believe that this is more cost effective and ecology friendly than buying books.

**Learnzapp** \
Learnzapp is a good source of questions to practice after you read books and answered all the questions 
in the books. It has mobile app and web version. It is possible to practice the questions in the exam mode.
I find it useful to find how exhausting it is to anwer over 100 questions in one go.

**Study Notes and Theory** \
Another good resource are study materials and questions from Luke Ahmed. His question set is intentionally very hard.
So my suggestion is to use it after you run through all the other materials.
However, do not do this questions just before the exam. As they are hard and tricky (more than the real exam)
you may get discouraged or loose self confidence when you cannot score the passing mark.

**Destination Certification Videos** \
Rob Witcher's CISSP MindMaps from Destination Certification are perfect for revision and finding areas that you need to study more.
The videos go through all domains and summarize the most important topics.

**Technical Institute of America** \
I found videos from Andrew Ramdayal just before the exam. 
They gave me confidence that I know the topics well.
After his 50 CISSP Practive Questions (Technical Institute of America), I decided to take the exam.
